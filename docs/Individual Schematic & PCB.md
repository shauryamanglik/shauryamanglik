**Functional Justification**

The schematic is built around the PIC18F27Q10 microcontroller, which interfaces with the AHT21 temperature sensor using I2C protocol. Based on the temperature reading, the MCU sends a command over UART to the motor driver subsystem to either spin forward, reverse, or stop. The command sent follows an 8-byte UART message format (e.g., FSSA01FS), representing forward, reverse, or off. The actuator module (A) responds with a confirmation (e.g., FSAS01FS), which triggers LED feedback in the sensor module (S). This complete loop of sensing, acting, confirming, and responding fulfills the product requirement of real-time feedback and responsiveness.



**Design & Decision Making Process**

Our team ideated on interactive and educational applications, eventually selecting a temperature-controlled spinning top. The design was broken into two subsystems: sensing and actuation. The sensor subsystem housed the AHT21 and handled temperature logic, while the driver subsystem received UART messages and spun the motor accordingly. We emphasized modularity for debugging and reused tested driver components like the IFX9201. We made the PCB compact, tested communication protocols in software, and iterated the UART messaging for consistent data transfer.



**Future Version 2.0 Improvements**

1. Integrated PCB (Single-Board Design):
Version 1.0 used two separate PCBs for sensing and motor control, which increased wiring complexity and introduced instability during spinning. A single PCB integrating the sensor, motor driver, and MCU would reduce size, improve balance, and simplify the system.

2. Onboard Power & Battery Support:
Currently reliant on external power, the system could benefit from an onboard buck converter and a LiPo battery interface. This would make the top portable and suitable for demonstrations or classroom use without cables.

3. Compact Motor Integration:
Replacing the bulky external motor with a mini brushless DC motor (BLDC) or embedded vibration motor would allow the entire spinning mechanism to be part of the board itself, improving balance and reducing moving parts.

4. Visual Feedback via RGB LED or Display:
Adding a color-coded LED or a small OLED screen can provide real-time feedback for motor direction or temperature values, enhancing usability and educational appeal.

5. Enhanced Communication Robustness:
The current UART protocol lacks error detection. Adding a checksum or timeout mechanism would prevent miscommunication and ensure safer, more reliable behavior.

6. Sensor Upgrade:
Replacing the AHT21 with a combined motion and temperature sensor (like MPU6050 or BMX160) could enable orientation-aware behavior, such as dynamic motor control or spin stability features.

7. Final Shell for Safety & Appearance:
A 3D-printed shell could house all electronics, protect the motor, and balance the weight for smoother spins. It would also make the device more durable and child-friendly for STEM outreach.

Together, these improvements would elevate the project from a working prototype to a robust, user-friendly, and educationally impactful product.
